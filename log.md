# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 05, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Decided what to do BRarvis - a brazilian version of Jarvis. I will use Intel Deep Learning SDK as a test.

**Thoughts:** Well, I have to have a Linux server to use SDK on a Windows client. I virtualised minimal CentOS7 on VirtualBox and set Bridged Mode of network interface, like [here](http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/diy-it-guy/using-virtualbox-vms-on-your-networks-subnet/). I had to configure manually network interface on CentOS like [here](http://www.mustbegeek.com/configure-static-ip-address-in-centos/) and them updated yum. I also installed wget, downloaded intel script with it. Then I extracted and ran script with bash. After installed it on server, I tried to install client SDK on Windows, however it gives me an error. But actually, I saw that was only necessary first installation, second made the same thing from Windows through SSH (actually it was kind of running before Windows installation).

**Link to work:** Nothing to show yet.

**TODO: Make another clean CentOS7 VM and let Windows install OR redo VM and install from there again.
